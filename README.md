# Elephant-Detection-and-Alerting-System

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)

This project is designed to automatically detect elephants using computer vision techniques and trigger alerts in real time. It is particularly useful in mitigating human-elephant conflicts in forest-fringe or agricultural areas by enabling early warnings. The system leverages deep learning models like YOLOv8 and integrates motion detection and video processing capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

- **üêò Elephant Detection**: Uses a pre-trained object detection model (`yolov8x.pt`) to identify elephants in video frames or image streams.
- **üé• Video Processing**: Supports live feed or pre-recorded footage (`video.mp4`) for continuous monitoring.
- **üîç Motion Detection**: Optional motion detection functionality (`Motion_detectioN_using_opencv/`) to reduce unnecessary processing.
- **üö® Alert System**: Built-in capability to trigger alerts (visual, sound, or notification) when an elephant is detected.
- **üß© Modular Structure**: Organized directories like `Main_code/` suggest separation of detection, processing, and alert logic.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Core Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - YOLOv8 (via `ultralytics`)
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
  - aiohttp, altair, absl-py
  - Tensor-based utilities and ML frameworks (as listed in `requirements.txt`)

> üì¶ Over 500 packages are listed in `requirements.txt`, covering computer vision, visualization, asynchronous operations, and machine learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the system on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/elephant-detection-and-alerting-system.git
   cd elephant-detection-and-alerting-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> üí° Consider using a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

The primary script appears to be `yolo_predict.py`, which likely uses YOLOv8 to process video input and detect elephants.

### Basic Example
```bash
python yolo_predict.py --source video.mp4
```

> Replace `video.mp4` with your own footage or use `0` for webcam feed.

### Additional Options
Explore the following:
- `Main_code/`: May contain structured detection pipelines and configurations.
- `Motion_detectioN_using_opencv/`: May include a standalone or auxiliary motion detection feature for performance optimization or event filtering.

For usage details and parameter tuning, check if `--help` is available:
```bash
python yolo_predict.py --help
```
